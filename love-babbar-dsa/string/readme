Security: Strings are often used to store sensitive information, such as
passwords, usernames, connection URLs, etc. If Strings were mutable, then
hackers could modify them and compromise the security of the application.
Caching: Strings are cached in a special memory region called the String pool,
which allows reusing the same String object for different variables. This
saves memory and improves performance. If Strings were mutable, then the
String pool would not work, as modifying one String would affect all the
others that share the same reference.
Synchronization: Strings are thread-safe, meaning that they can be safely
shared and accessed by multiple threads without causing concurrency issues. If
Strings were mutable, then synchronization would be required to avoid data
inconsistency and race conditions.
Class loading: Strings are used by the JVM to load classes and resolve
dependencies. If Strings were mutable, then the class loading mechanism would
be unreliable, as the class names could be changed at runtime.
